# Repo-local git credential helper that pins GitHub auth to the `jroberts64`
# account for THIS repository only (the repo lives at jroberts64/home-office).
#
# Why: `gh` shares one "active account" across all repos. When it's switched to
# another account (e.g. a work account), pushes to this repo are denied with
# HTTP 403. This helper makes `gh` serve the jroberts64 token regardless of the
# global active account, without changing any global git/gh config.
#
# Wiring (one-time, repo-local — done in deploy/setup-git-account.sh):
#   git config --local credential.https://github.com.helper \
#     "!\"$(pwd)/deploy/git-credential-jroberts64.sh\""
#
# git invokes a helper with one arg: get | store | erase. We only handle `get`;
# store/erase are no-ops (gh manages token storage in the keychain).
